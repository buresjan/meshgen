    Load a mesh from a file, voxelize it with or without splitting, and adjust it for LBM simulations.

    This function loads a mesh from the specified path and calculates an appropriate voxel size based

    splitting it into segments, depending on the 'split' parameter. The voxelized mesh is adjusted
    using the 'complete_mesh' function to make it suitable for LBM simulations.

    Parameters:
    path (str): The file path of the mesh to be loaded and voxelized.
    res (int, optional): A resolution factor for voxelization. Default is 1.
    split (int, optional): The number of segments to split the mesh into before voxelization.
                           If None, the mesh is voxelized without splitting. Default is None.
    num_processes(int, optional): The number of subprocesses the main process should be divided into.
